      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "How does SafetyNet protect my privacy?",
      "answer": "Your information stays private until you need help. We only store what you explicitly set up (safe times, emergency contacts, custom messages). No continuous location tracking, no background data collection. Your safety information is only shared with your chosen contacts if an alert is triggered."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-2",
      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "What security and reliability measures will SafetyNet have?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">SafetyNet is built with enterprise-grade security and reliability as our foundation:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3\"><li>Industry-standard encryption to protect your data</li><li>Reliable cloud infrastructure with backup systems</li><li>Multi-channel alert delivery to ensure your contacts are notified</li><li>99.9% uptime commitment with continuous monitoring</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-700\"><strong>Our promise:</strong> We will not launch publicly until we achieve 99.9% alert delivery success in testing. Your safety is our priority.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-18",
      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "Who can see my safety information?",
      "answer": "No one sees your safety information when you set up a SafetyNet. Only when an alert is triggered do your chosen contacts get access. Your plans, location, and activities stay private until your need for safety overrides it."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-19",
      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "What do you do with my data?",
      "answer": "Nothing. We don't sell your data. Ever. Your safety information is exactly that — yours."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-3",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "How does it work offline or with a dead battery?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">SafetyNet doesn't rely on your phone to send the Safety Alert — our servers do.</p><p class=\"mb-3\">Here's the difference: other apps wait for your phone to send an SOS. SafetyNet waits for you to not check in — that's the signal something is wrong.</p><p class=\"mb-3\">You set your Safe Time based on your plans. We remind you before it expires. And there's extra time built in — so alerts only send when something's genuinely wrong.</p><p class=\"mb-3\">When you set a Safe Time, our servers start a countdown. If you check in, the countdown stops. If you don't — for any reason (dead battery, no signal, you can't reach your phone) — the Safety Alert sends automatically.</p><p>Your phone only needs to work when you set the Safe Time and when you check in. Everything else runs independently.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-4",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "Will this drain my battery?",
      "answer": "No significant battery drain. SafetyNet uses minimal resources because the monitoring happens in the cloud, not on your device. You only interact with the app when setting up a safe time or checking in, which takes seconds."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-5",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "What if I forget to check in but I'm safe?",
      "answer": "We include customizable extra time and reminder notifications before any alert is sent. If an alert does go out, you can immediately cancel it with one tap to let your contacts know it was a false alarm. We're designed to minimize false alarms while keeping you safe."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-16",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "How do I add my contact?",
      "answer": "You can add your contact when you create your SafetyNet and/or select a previously saved contact."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-17",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "What if I forget to check in?",
      "answer": "You'll get a reminder first. Plenty of time to check in before any alert is sent."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-6",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "What are SafetyNet's limitations?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">SafetyNet is a powerful safety tool, but it's important to understand its limitations:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2\"><li>Requires initial internet connection to set your Safe Time</li><li>Relies on your emergency contact's ability to receive SMS, email, or push notifications</li><li>Cannot prevent emergencies—only facilitates faster response if something goes wrong</li><li>While we maintain 99.9% uptime, no system is 100% foolproof. Always have backup safety plans</li></ul><p class=\"mt-3 text-slate-800 font-medium\">SafetyNet is designed as an additional layer of protection, not a replacement for common sense safety practices.</p>"

      "id": "faq-7",
      "category": "why-safetynet",
      "question": "How is this different from Find My Friends or Life360?",
      "answer": "Location sharing apps require your phone to be working. If you can't reach your phone (dead battery, no signal, emergency situation), they fail silently - your contacts just see your last location and don't know if you're okay or in trouble. SafetyNet sends a clear alert with your context and instructions, so there's no ambiguity. We're built specifically for the scenario where \"text me when you're safe\" doesn't work."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-20",
      "category": "why-safetynet",
      "question": "Will my contacts get constant notifications?",
      "answer": "No. Contacts only hear from SafetyNet when an alert is triggered. Their day stays interruption-free."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-21",
      "category": "why-safetynet",
      "question": "Why did you start SafetyNet?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">I came across many scenarios where people didn't realise the problem with \"text me when you're safe.\" The pattern was always the same: everyone assumed they were fine — until they weren't. No signal. No essential context. No instructions. This conflicted with the safeguards I used every day in business.</p><p class=\"mb-3 font-semibold text-slate-900\">A selection of moments that helped define the mission:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3\"><li><strong>The bad date</strong> — Stuck in an unsafe situation for hours. No one knew there was a problem because she couldn't text.</li><li><strong>The compromised state</strong> — A friend's drink was spiked on a business trip. He became unconscious, so he couldn't ask for help.</li><li><strong>The solo accident</strong> — A colleague slipped while hiking alone. No one knew she was in trouble until it was too late.</li><li><strong>The false assumption</strong> — Friends held hostage in an Airbnb. Everyone assumed they were safe because they were \"together.\"</li><li><strong>The traveller's fear</strong> — \"If I stopped posting on social media, how long would it take for anyone to actually notice?\"</li><li><strong>The missing context</strong> — Even when someone was reported missing, search teams had no starting point.</li></ul><p class=\"mb-3 font-semibold text-slate-900\">Now with SafetyNet, your freedom is protected.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">SafetyNet doesn't restrict your life — it enables it. Go on that date. Take the solo trip. Run the new route. Move to the new city.</p><p>Because now, someone will know if something goes wrong.</p>"

      "question": "When will SafetyNet be available?",
      "answer": "We're currently in development and building our early access waitlist. Join the waitlist to be among the first to use SafetyNet when we launch. Early access members will get priority access and the opportunity to shape the product with their feedback."

      "category": "launch-pricing",
      "question": "Will SafetyNet be free?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">We're evaluating pricing options to make SafetyNet accessible while sustaining reliable 24/7 monitoring. We expect to offer both free and paid tiers.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900\">Early access waitlist members will receive special benefits and discounted pricing, regardless of final structure.</p>"

      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "What does my emergency contact need to do?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">When you add an emergency contact, they receive a one-time confirmation message explaining SafetyNet and asking them to accept. Takes 10 seconds, no app required.</p><p class=\"mb-3\"><strong>After that:</strong> They hear nothing unless an alert triggers. No spam, no updates, no interruptions - SafetyNet operates silently unless you need help.</p><p class=\"text-sm text-slate-700\"><strong>If an alert triggers:</strong> They receive your custom message and instructions via SMS, email, and push notification (if they have the app). They'll know exactly what's happening and what to do.</p>"

      "id": "faq-11",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "How do I set up a customized message and instructions for Safety Alerts?",

      "id": "faq-12",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "Will my emergency contact get spammed with notifications?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>No.</strong> Your emergency contact only receives notifications if a safety alert triggers. 99% of the time, they never hear from SafetyNet.</p><p class=\"text-sm text-slate-600\">When you check in safely (which is the normal case), nothing is sent to your contact. SafetyNet is designed for peace of mind without interrupting anyone's day.</p>"

      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "What devices does SafetyNet work on?",
      "answer": "SafetyNet will be available on iOS (latest version), Android (latest version), and web browsers. Most modern smartphones and tablets from the last 3-4 years are supported. You'll also be able to manage your SafetyNet settings from any web browser on desktop or mobile."

    {
      "id": "faq-14",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "Does my emergency contact need the app?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>No.</strong> Your emergency contacts don't need to download or install anything.</p><p>They'll receive alerts via SMS and email if a safety alert is triggered. If they choose to download the app, they can receive push notifications too, but it's completely optional.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-15",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "Who else needs the app?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Just you.</strong> Only the person setting up SafetyNet needs the app.</p><p>Your emergency contacts will receive alerts through standard channels (SMS, email) without needing to download anything. SafetyNet is designed to work seamlessly without requiring your contacts to install additional software.</p>"
