# Governance Glossary

**Authoritative Vocabulary — Governance Layer**

**Version:** v1.2
**Status:** Foundation Artefact
**Scope:** Governs interpretation across all governance and execution artefacts

---

## 0. Authority, Scope, and Change Control

### 0.1 Authority Level

This Governance Glossary is a **Foundation artefact**.

Its definitions:

* are **authoritative**,
* bind **all other governance artefacts**,
* override default, colloquial, or model-inferred meanings.

If a definition here conflicts with another artefact, **this glossary governs interpretation**.

---

### 0.2 Scope of Applicability

This glossary applies to:

* all governance artefacts,
* all ADRs,
* all derivative artefacts authorised by those ADRs,
* all AI-assisted or human-assisted work operating under this system.

Undefined terms have **no governance authority** (see §14).

---

### 0.3 Versioning Rule

* Every governance artefact **must reference the glossary version** it is bound to.
* Derivative artefacts inherit the glossary version referenced by their **authorising ADR**.

**Rule:**
A derivative artefact is governed by the glossary version referenced by its ADR, **not** by later glossary versions.

This prevents retroactive semantic drift.

---

### 0.4 Update Process

Changes to this glossary:

* require a **new version number**,
* must be approved via an **ADR** (e.g. *ADR-G-001: Update Governance Glossary*),
* must explicitly declare:

  * what changed,
  * whether backward compatibility holds (see §0.5).

There are **no silent amendments**.

---

### 0.5 Backward Compatibility (Glossary Context)

A glossary change is **backward-compatible** if:

> Artefacts valid under version *v(n)* remain valid under *v(n+1)* **without reinterpretation or reclassification**.

Changes that:

* narrow a definition,
* broaden a definition,
* or redefine a term such that existing artefacts must be re-evaluated,

are **backward-incompatible** and must be explicitly declared as such.

---

### 0.6 Conflict Resolution Precedence

If two **Foundation artefacts** appear to conflict, interpretation precedence is:

1. **Governance Glossary** (definitions)
2. **Normative Contract** (what must be true)
3. **Artefact Checklist** (what must exist)
4. **Binding Addendum** (how artefacts map to a stack)
5. **ADR** (what was chosen)

Conflicts are resolved by **interpretation**, not modification, unless an ADR explicitly revises governance.

---

## 1. Artefact

A **concrete, reviewable unit of intent or execution** with a **defined authority level** in the system lifecycle.

An artefact is valid **only if**:

* its role is explicit,
* its authority is classified (Foundation or Derivative),
* its direction of influence is one-way.

Anything that fails these conditions is **not an artefact**.

---

## 2. Foundation Artefact

An artefact that **defines constraints** and **binds all downstream behavior**.

Foundation artefacts:

* must exist **before execution**,
* cannot be safely inferred or generated by AI,
* constrain all derivative artefacts.

Examples:

* Wiring Spec
* Artefact Checklist
* Binding Addendum (+ Appendix B)
* Governance Glossary
* ADRs

---

## 3. Derivative Artefact

An artefact that **implements, enforces, or explains** foundation artefacts.

Derivative artefacts:

* are created **after an ADR**,
* must conform to governance,
* must never introduce new requirements, guarantees, or scope.

Examples:

* Code
* Test plans
* CI rules
* Diagrams

Derivative artefacts are **non-authoritative**.

---

## 4. Governance

The collection of **Foundation artefacts** whose purpose is to:

* constrain interpretation,
* define authority,
* prevent ambiguity,
* bound AI and human behavior.

Governance:

* precedes execution,
* is authoritative,
* is not optional.

Governance ≠ documentation
Governance ≠ process
Governance ≠ implementation

---

## 5. Normative Contract

A governance artefact that defines **what must be true**, independent of technology or implementation.

It:

* specifies invariants,
* defines allowed and forbidden behavior,
* declares accepted risks,
* contains no implementation detail.

---

## 6. Artefact Checklist

A governance artefact that defines **what must exist** to satisfy the normative contract.

It:

* enumerates required artefacts,
* remains stack-agnostic,
* does not prescribe implementation.

---

## 7. Binding Addendum

A **non-normative governance artefact** that maps existing artefacts to a specific technology stack.

A Binding Addendum:

* does **not** make decisions,
* does **not** change guarantees,
* preserves control roles,
* may coexist with other binding addenda.

It answers only:

> “If this stack is used, how are the artefacts realised?”

---

## 8. ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

A **decisional artefact** that:

* selects between valid options,
* records why the choice was made,
* commits the system to that choice.

ADRs:

* reference governance artefacts,
* freeze decisions,
* authorise execution.

**Bootstrap rule:**
ADR-001 may be created once the following minimum governance exists:

* Wiring Spec
* Artefact Checklist
* Governance Glossary

A Binding Addendum is **not required** to create the first ADR.

---

## 9. Binding

The act of mapping an abstract artefact or control role to a concrete platform primitive.

Binding:

* is descriptive, not justificatory,
* must preserve the original control role,
* must fail if equivalence cannot be maintained.

---

## 10. Control Role

The **functional purpose** a control serves, independent of vendor or implementation.

Vendor features **must not redefine control roles**.

---

## 11. Execution

The act of building and deploying derivative artefacts.

Execution:

* is forbidden before an ADR,
* must conform to governance,
* is verified **against**, not **by**, governance artefacts.

---

## 12. Verification

The process of checking derivative artefacts **against governance**.

Verification:

* detects non-compliance,
* cannot justify deviation,
* escalates violations via governance.

---

## 13. Enforcement & Escalation

**Enforcement occurs via:**

* governance-based review, **owned by humans**,
* tool-assisted analysis that **flags violations**,
* rejection of non-compliant derivatives **by human decision**,
* blocking merge/deploy paths **only when explicitly configured and approved by the system owner**.

**AI tools have no autonomous enforcement authority by default.**

Tool-assisted enforcement provides **recommendations only**, unless:

* a deterministic rule set is explicitly defined in governance artefacts, and
* explicitly authorised by the system owner.

**Escalation path:**

1. Derivative → ADR (decision ambiguity)
2. ADR → Governance revision (definition gap)
3. Governance revision → New glossary version

The **terminal authority** is the system owner approving changes via ADR.

---

## 14. Scope Boundary Rule

If a term is **not defined** in this glossary:

* it may appear in artefacts,
* but it has **no governance authority**,
* and cannot be used to justify decisions or behavior.

This creates a **controlled open vocabulary**, not a closed one.

---

## 15. Semantic Evasion Rule

Renaming or re-labelling does **not** bypass governance.

Forbidden evasion includes:

* “implementation guide” instead of derivative artefact
* “execution notes” instead of code
* “operational heuristic” instead of control

**Rule:**
Authority is determined by **function**, not by name.

If functional classification (Foundation vs Derivative) is ambiguous or disputed, **final determination is made by the system owner via the escalation process defined in §13**.

---

## 16. Doom Loop

A failure mode where:

* derivatives influence governance,
* AI invents structure to resolve ambiguity,
* execution retroactively justifies decisions.

Prevented by:

* explicit definitions,
* one-way authority,
* versioned governance.

---

## 17. Non-Artefact

Anything with **no governance authority**, including:

* conversations,
* prompts,
* exploratory notes,
* unreferenced AI outputs.

Non-artefacts **must not** justify decisions or execution.

---

### Takeaways

* This glossary is **self-governing**, versioned, and enforceable
* Authority, escalation, and evolution are explicit
* AI is constrained; humans retain final control
* Semantic drift and evasion are explicitly blocked

### Next steps

* Freeze **Governance Glossary v1.2**
* Reference it explicitly from **ADR-001**
* Use it as the **authoritative vocabulary** for all future governance and execution work
