Last updated: December 2024

## 1. Who We Are

SafetyNet is operated by Acorn 360 Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales. We are the data controller for your personal data. You can contact us at: [hello@safetynetbeta.com](mailto:hello@safetynetbeta.com)

## 2. What We Collect

When you join our waitlist, we collect your **email address**. That's it.

We also use privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible) which does not use cookies and does not collect personal data. This tells us how many people visit our site, not who they are.

## 3. Why We Collect It

We use your email address to notify you when SafetyNet launches and to send occasional updates about our progress. Our legal basis under UK GDPR is your **consent**, which you give when you submit the waitlist form.

## 4. Who We Share Data With

We use Vercel to host our website. Your email is stored securely and is not shared with any third parties for marketing purposes. We will never sell your data.

## 5. How Long We Keep Your Data

We keep your email address until SafetyNet launches and you either create an account or ask to be removed from our list. If you unsubscribe, we delete your data within 30 days.

## 6. Your Rights

Under UK GDPR, you have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. You can withdraw consent at any time by emailing us or clicking unsubscribe in any email we send.

If you have concerns about how we handle your data, you can contact the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) at [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk).

## 7. Age Restriction

SafetyNet is intended for users aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 18.

## 8. Security

We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS).

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as SafetyNet develops. We will notify waitlist members of significant changes by email.
