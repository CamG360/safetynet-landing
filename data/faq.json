      "id": "faq-1",
      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "How does SafetyNet protect my privacy?",
      "answer": "Your information stays private until you need help. We only store what you explicitly set up (safe times, emergency contacts, custom messages). No continuous location tracking, no background data collection. Your safety information is only shared with your chosen contacts if an alert is triggered."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-2",
      "category": "privacy",
      "question": "What security and reliability measures will SafetyNet have?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">SafetyNet is currently in beta testing with 50 users. We're building on enterprise-grade infrastructure:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-3\"><li>Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with multi-region redundancy</li><li>Bank-level encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)</li><li>Multi-channel alert delivery (SMS, email, push notifications)</li><li>99.9% uptime target with continuous monitoring</li></ul><p class=\"text-sm text-slate-700\"><strong>Our commitment:</strong> We will not launch publicly until we achieve 99.9% alert delivery success rate in testing. Security audit scheduled for Q1 2025.</p>"

      "id": "faq-3",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "How does it work offline or with a dead battery?",
      "answer": "SafetyNet operates from the cloud, not your phone. When you set a safe time, our servers monitor it independently. If you don't check in (whether due to no signal, dead battery, or any other reason), the alert goes out automatically. Your phone doesn't need to be working for the system to function."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-4",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "Will this drain my battery?",
      "answer": "No significant battery drain. SafetyNet uses minimal resources because the monitoring happens in the cloud, not on your device. You only interact with the app when setting up a safe time or checking in, which takes seconds."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-5",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "What if I forget to check in but I'm safe?",
      "answer": "We include customizable grace periods and reminder notifications before any alert is sent. If an alert does go out, you can immediately cancel it with one tap to let your contacts know it was a false alarm. We're designed to minimize false alarms while keeping you safe."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-6",
      "category": "how-it-works",
      "question": "What are SafetyNet's limitations?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">SafetyNet is a powerful safety tool, but it's important to understand its limitations:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2\"><li>Requires initial internet connection to set your Safe Time</li><li>Relies on your emergency contact's ability to receive SMS, email, or push notifications</li><li>Cannot prevent emergencies—only facilitates faster response if something goes wrong</li><li>While we maintain 99.9% uptime, no system is 100% foolproof. Always have backup safety plans</li></ul><p class=\"mt-3 text-slate-800 font-medium\">SafetyNet is designed as an additional layer of protection, not a replacement for common sense safety practices.</p>"

    {
      "id": "faq-7",
      "category": "why-safetynet",
      "question": "How is this different from Find My Friends or Life360?",
      "answer": "Location sharing apps require your phone to be working. If you can't reach your phone (dead battery, no signal, emergency situation), they fail silently - your contacts just see your last location and don't know if you're okay or in trouble. SafetyNet sends a clear alert with your context and instructions, so there's no ambiguity. We're built specifically for the scenario where \"text me when you're safe\" doesn't work."

    {

      "category": "launch-pricing",
      "question": "When will SafetyNet be available?",
      "answer": "We're currently in development and building our early access waitlist. Join the waitlist to be among the first to use SafetyNet when we launch. Early access members will get priority access and the opportunity to shape the product with their feedback."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-9",
      "category": "launch-pricing",
      "question": "Will SafetyNet be free?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">We're evaluating pricing options to make SafetyNet accessible while sustaining reliable 24/7 monitoring. We expect to offer both free and paid tiers.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900\">Early access waitlist members will receive special benefits and discounted pricing, regardless of final structure.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-10",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "What does my emergency contact need to do?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-3\">When you add an emergency contact, they receive a one-time confirmation message explaining SafetyNet and asking them to accept. Takes 10 seconds, no app required.</p><p class=\"mb-3\"><strong>After that:</strong> They hear nothing unless an alert triggers. No spam, no updates, no interruptions - SafetyNet operates silently unless you need help.</p><p class=\"text-sm text-slate-700\"><strong>If an alert triggers:</strong> They receive your custom message and instructions via SMS, email, and push notification (if they have the app). They'll know exactly what's happening and what to do.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-11",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "How do I set up a customized message and instructions for Safety Alerts?",
      "answer": "You can create your customized message and instructions when you create a SafetyNet."
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-12",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "Will my emergency contact get spammed with notifications?",
      "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>No.</strong> Your emergency contact only receives notifications if a safety alert triggers. 99% of the time, they never hear from SafetyNet.</p><p class=\"text-sm text-slate-600\">When you check in safely (which is the normal case), nothing is sent to your contact. SafetyNet is designed for peace of mind without interrupting anyone's day.</p>"
    },
    {
      "id": "faq-13",
      "category": "getting-started",
      "question": "What devices does SafetyNet work on?",
      "answer": "SafetyNet will be available on iOS (latest version), Android (latest version), and web browsers. Most modern smartphones and tablets from the last 3-4 years are supported. You'll also be able to manage your SafetyNet settings from any web browser on desktop or mobile."
