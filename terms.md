By accessing the Site or joining our waitlist, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.

## 2. Waitlist

The waitlist is for early access notification only. Joining the waitlist does not guarantee access to SafetyNet, any particular features, pricing, or launch timeline. We may modify, delay, or cancel the product at our sole discretion.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old to use this Site or join the waitlist.

## 4. Intellectual Property

All content on this Site—including text, graphics, logos, concepts, and design—is owned by Acorn 360 Ltd and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without our written permission.

**Submissions**: If you submit ideas, feedback, suggestions, or other content to us (by email or any other means), you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, modify, and incorporate that content into our products without restriction or compensation.

## 5. Acceptable Use

## 6. Disclaimers

The Site and waitlist are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Site will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Acorn 360 Ltd and its directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the Site or waitlist.

Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the Site shall not exceed £100.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.

## 9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. Changes take effect when posted to the Site. Continued use of the Site after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 10. Dispute Resolution

If you have a dispute with us, please contact us first at [hello@safetynetbeta.com](mailto:hello@safetynetbeta.com). We will attempt to resolve the matter informally within 30 days.

If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction, and these Terms shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.
